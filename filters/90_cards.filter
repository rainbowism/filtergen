#Single turn ins - cards with a stack size of 1. Flagged same as lavender tier as a reminder to separate them when you pick them up. Really more for organizational purposes as the lavender tier block is getting kinda big.

#Low Tier: Shit or Very Common Div Cards: No sounds on these, darker blue color. IMPORTANT: More about removing cards that drop a lot to remove sound spam than removing low value cards - cards that are low value but actually rare should still show unless they're total dogshit. Everything here should be <1 chaos.

#Beyond trash tier: Actually hidden in all filters, literally a waste of a click to pick up. Only the very worst get added here, used VERY sparingly.
